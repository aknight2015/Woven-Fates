| Roll 2d6 | Station Type                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11 - 16  | Egarian Void-Maze: The station is a baffling construct of crystals with no readily apparent purpose or function, but build along similar geometrical principles as the dead cities of the Egarian Dominion                                                                                                                             |
| 21 - 26  | Eldar Orrery: The station is constructed of the smooth, bone-like material from which the Eldar make their ships, and is riddled with cloistered cells. Examination by a Navigator or a psyker hits at a long-vanished power permeating the structure.                                                                                 |
| 31 - 36  | Eldar Gate: This vast Eldar contraption resembles nothing so much as the frame of an enormous door, but only the empty void shows through it. No amount of searching yields a sign of its purpose or function.                                                                                                                         |
| 41 - 44  | Ork Rok:  From the outside, this “station” appears to be nothing more than a lonely, out of the way asteroid. Despite its appearance, it has been thoroughly hollowed out, and filled with dubious Orky technology. Some of the technology might even have worked at one point.                                                        |
| 45 - 51  | STC Defense Station: The core of the station is based off a standard pattern derived from Standard Template Construct technology, like countless others throughout the Imperium. What remains of the banks of weapon batteries and torpedo bays indicates that it was once intended to safeguard a human colony from attack.           |
| 52 - 54  | STC Monitor Station: The core of the station is based off a standard pattern derived from Standard Template Construct technology, like countless others throughout the Imperium. Despite its age, the hull still bristles with auger arrays and reception panels that indicate its former use as a communications or intelligence hub. |
| 55 - 61  | Stryxis Collection:Calling this accumulation of wreckage and junk a space station would insult an Ork Mek, much less a shipwright of the Adeptus Mechanicus. The only explanation for its accretion comes from the vox-beacon broadcasting some kind of territorial claim by the Stryxis.                                              |
| 61 - 63  | Xenos Defense Station: The architecture of the station does not match any examples yet encountered, but it is clearly inhuman in origin. Though the technology that comprises it is strange, there is no mistaking the intended purpose of its decaying armaments.                                                                     |
| 64 - 66  | Xenos Monitor Station: The architecture of the station does not match any examples yet encountered, but it is clearly inhuman in origin. Its purpose is hard to ascertain for sure, but some of the arcane devices that line its hull resemble vox hubs and other necessities for a deep space monitor station.                        |

| Roll 2d6 | Fleet Composition |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| 11 -16   | Crushed Defence Force/Routed Invasion: The wreckage is all that remains of a defeated battlefleet. Whichever side of the long-ago conflict that fielded these vessels was decisively defeated, with most or all of the hulks belonging to the same force. The graveyard consists of 2d5 ships, of which most or all have been shattered beyond any value.                  |
| 21 - 26  | Fleet Engagement: A massive conflict once raged here, as evidenced by the abundance of battle-scarred hulls left behind by both sides. The graveyard consists of 1d10+6 hulks, and can also include vast fields of unexploded mines, spent volleys of torpedoes, or the drifting wings of attack craft. Roughly half of the ships and materiel expended came from each side. The fury of the conflict consumed much of value, but the sturdy construction of warships means that at least a few of them might be worth salvaging.                  |
| 31 - 36  |  Lost Explorers: These ships were not lost to enemy action, but to overextended supply vaults, or the failure of long suffering vital systems. The expedition is unlikely to include as many as even half a dozen ships, but few (if any) of them have deteriorated enough to prohibit salvage efforts.                 |
| 41 - 46  |  Plundered Convoy: A lost shipping lane of some kind might have once crossed this system, as evidenced by this gutted procession of transports and cargo vessels. Their holds have been long since emptied, but it is possible their attackers might have missed something of value. There are 1d5+2 ships in the convoy, of which most or all remain intact enough to allow boarding, but little else.                 |
| 51 - 56  |  Skirmish: Elements from two different battlefleets clashed here, with each leaving behind a handful of their complement. The graveyard consists of 1d5+3 hulks. Roughly half of the ships came from each side. The fury of the conflict all ships involved, but the sturdy construction of warships means that at least a few of them might be worth salvaging.                 |
| 61 - 66      | Unknown Provenance: The bizarre assortment of different vessels drifting past defies easy explanation. It is likely to bring to mind the eerie legends of the Processional of the Damned, where broken ships from across the Expanse arrive like spectres in some strange afterlife. Whether associated with that haunted realm, or the result of some more mundane confusion, the graveyard consists of the twisted wreckage of dozens of utterly ruined ships of all kinds, as well as 1d5 hulks in varying degrees of integrity. None of the hulks share an origin.                  |
