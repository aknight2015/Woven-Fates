## SYSTEM ELEMENTS
The following list details the most common features found within star systems, and their typical effects. Generally speaking, multiple instances of a single System Element simply mean that there are multiple different System Elements of that type in the area that the Explorers can seek to exploit or must attempt to negotiate. Solar Flares are an exception, as described in their entry (see page 17).

##### ASTEROID BELT
Some systems are wrapped in a vast ring of debris, formed from shattered or stillborn planets. Whatever bonds once held the circling fragments together have since yielded to outside forces, but the inescapable draw of the local star maintains the remaining cohesion. The encircling line of an Asteroid Belt can cause difficulties to ships seeking passage deeper into the system. Any direct route requires successful navigation of the ring, although it is possible to bypass an Asteroid Belt by leaving the orbital plane of the system. Such detours tend to be lengthy, often adding several full days of travel. Navigating an Asteroid Belt follows the rules for Asteroid Fields on pages 226–227 of the ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook, although its diffusion across the System means that successfully passing through requires only an Easy (+20) Pilot (Space Craft)+Manoeuvrability Test. Asteroid Belts generate 1d5 Mineral Resources (see page 27).

##### ASTEROID CLUSTER
A full-bodied and cohesive Asteroid Cluster is usually formed from the remains of a planet or moon that has undergone some incredible cataclysm. The pieces are held together by what is left of the planetoid’s gravitational field, although spread out over a rather larger area of space. Pirates frequently use the obscuring screen of an Asteroid Cluster to their advantage, and valuable salvage can occasionally be found drifting amongst the rocks. Wise captains are aware that such salvage is usually derived from those same pirates, or from others who did not respect the dangers of an asteroid field, and attempt retrieval accordingly. Navigating an Asteroid Cluster follows the rules for Asteroid Fields on pages 226–227 of the ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook. Smaller fields of asteroids are often formed by the collision of large bodies, or the degraded wreckage of truly ancient vessels, but these pockets are not considered System Elements. Asteroid Clusters generate 1d5 Mineral Resources (see page 27).

##### DERELICT STATION 
The remains of orbital habitats, system defence stations, and deep space monitoring outposts can be found drifting through many systems. Even those that have never developed life of their own might house the relics of past explorers and would-be colonists. In systems with an active void-faring civilisation, such stations tend to be either relics of a surpassed level of technology, or a barely intact shell, abandoned to rising construction costs or disastrous systems failure. Whatever their origin, even the gutted remnants of a space station could contain valuable technology, or useful records on those who constructed it.

If there is an active civilisation of the appropriate Development level in the System, then the Derelict Station most likely belongs to them. If the System is devoid of past or present life, roll on Table 1–4: Derelict Station Origins to determine its creators and original purpose and then generate 1d5–1 (to a minimum of 0) Archeotech Cache or Xenos Ruins Resources aboard the station (see page 27). If the Station is fired upon in ship combat or suffers collateral damage from some other source, treat it as having 10 Armour, between 4d10 points of Hull Integrity, and no other defences. For the purposes of any Endeavours to extract the Resources aboard a Derelict Station, it can be treated as a Derelict Vessel Encounter Site (see pages 59–60). At the Game Master’s discretion, the Explorers might be required to board the lonely station themselves to locate these resources, walking through the shadowy halls as voracious eyes gleam from the darkness.

##### DUST CLOUD
Clouds of gas, cosmic debris, and other minutiae drift through many systems. They originate in a variety of ways— some are the remains of an asteroid field, long since battered into the finest particles, and others contain the dissipating fury of an erupting solar flare, dwindling to near oblivion before being replenished by the next burst of plasma. These differences are rarely considered in depth by Rogue Traders, who have no use for them, except perhaps as concealment for their vessel. Dust Clouds follow the rules for Nebulae on page 227 of the ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook. Smaller dust clouds often form on a temporary basis, but these are not considered proper System Elements as generated by this System.

##### GAS GIANT
Though the Imperium primarily desires worlds that humans can survive on (or, failing that, walk on), the presence of a gas giant on the reports from a long range scan has excited the interest of many of a Rogue Trader with the thought of the moons that might be concealed by its bulk. While there is no guarantee that a gas giant has lesser worlds in its orbit, much less that they are of any value, there have been enough fortunes made by a tightly-packed cluster of useful moons to give these massive orbs a reputation for good luck. This association has been helped in no small part by the legendary craft constructed at the Jovian shipyards, and the many STCstandard ship components that bear their name. Gas Giants are generated with the aid of the Planet Creation (see page 19).

##### GRAVITY RIPTIDE
The signs that warn of these destructive vortices can be nearly impossible to spot until a voidship is nearly upon them, the augers registering the anomaly barely soon enough to scream a klaxon of warning. The customary sweep of a newly discovered system seldom, if ever, turns up these hazards from the distance at which it is made. More often, they remain undetected and unknown until a ship’s path crosses their influence. The fear of these unseen hazards plagues many veteran voidsmen, and any attempt to make use of a system in which they are present inevitably involves mapping them on the charts and rutters of the exploring fleet. Gravity Riptides follow the rules for Gravity Tides on page 227 of the ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook.

##### PLANET
It is said that the Imperium is comprised of a million different worlds, across the galaxy. Though the precise number rises and falls with each righteous crusade launched, or warzone lost to the enemy, it is incontestable that the reach of Mankind spans the galaxy across untold dominions, united under the rule of the God-Emperor. There are some who would take this to mean that the ambitions of Rogue Traders are folly, for claiming lasting glory across such a wide dominion is impossible for a mortal man. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these melancholy types are rarely granted the rights of the Warrant of Trade, for such power belongs in the hands of those who see more clearly. Rogue Traders who understand the true nature of power rejoice with each new world they bring into the GodEmperor’s dominion, be it ever so small and benighted—for to raise the banner of empire over a million worlds, it is first necessary to raise that banner across each and every one. Planets are generated with the aid of the Planet Creation step of the World Generator, on page 19.

##### RADIATION BURSTS
The forces radiating out from the inner furnace of a star consist of far more than heat and illumination. The roiling fires of a star are far beyond the mightiest earthly blaze, and cast out through the system what some among the Adeptus Mechanicus call “the Light Invisible.” According to the doctrines of the Priesthood of Mars, visible light is but a small part of a spectrum of different energies. The auger arrays of voidships rely in large part on these forces, and are often overwhelmed by an excess of input when travelling close to particularly active stars. Though Rogue Traders are not generally inclined to the techno-theological theories that explain these matters, those who go through the harrowing experience of guiding a vessel blinded by bursts of stellar radiation often pay a great deal more respect and attention to the counsel of their Enginseers afterwards. Unlike most System Elements, Radiation Bursts do not represent an actual presence within the System. Instead, they exert an influence over the Solar Zone in which they are present (almost invariably the Inner Cauldron). The Detection bonus of any ship in the affected area is halved, as constant low-grade interference degrades any readings gathered. In addition, activity within an affected star can result in a surge of radiation throughout the Solar Zone. Such surges tend to be infrequent, spaced over periods of weeks, months, or more, but can occur as often as every 1d5 days after a sufficient build-up. Spotting the fluctuations that precede a radiation surge requires an Ordinary (+10) Scrutiny+Detection Test. Avoiding the effects requires leaving the affected Solar Zone, sheltering behind a nearby Planet or Gas Giant, or by temporarily insulating the ship’s augers with a Hard (–20) Tech–Use Test. Any ship caught unprotected within the area of effect suffers the effects of a Sensors Damaged critical result from page 222 of the ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook, and additionally, cannot send or receive vox transmissions. This Damage cannot be repaired until at least 1d5 hours after the surge, due to the lingering presence of these ravaging energies. A Solar Zone generated with multiple instances of Radiation Bursts further degrades the efficiency of augers within the affected area. The Detection bonus of affected ships is reduced by 5 per additional instance of the System Element after being halved.

##### SOLAR FLARES
Though a star provides light and structure to the surrounding system, it is a power best appreciated at a great distance. Seeking the treasures of the Inner Cauldron can make a cautious captain rich, but it can utterly destroy the greedy and reckless. Many stars seethe with volatile energies that erupt forth with little notice, and consume whatever is caught in their cataclysmic path. Unlike most System Elements, Solar Flares do not represent an actual presence within the System. Instead, they exert an influence over the Solar Zone in which they are present (almost invariably the Inner Cauldron). Each day a ship remains in this area, roll 1d10; on a result of 10 or higher, the ship is caught in the effects of a Solar Flare, unless it can find shelter in a safe orbit behind a sheltering object. Treat the effects of a Solar Flare as inflicting 1d5 hits from a Macrobattery with a Damage of 1d10+3. This Damage is stopped by Void Shields. Further, the effects of the flare are spread across such a vast area that it does not inflict Critical Hits like a weapon with a Crit Rating. Damage past the Armour of a Crippled ship still inflicts Critical Hits normally. A Solar Zone generated with multiple instances of Solar Flares is plagued with more frequent and widespread outbursts. For each instance of this System Element, add +1 to the 1d10 roll for determining if there is a Solar Flare that day.

##### STARSHIP GRAVEYARD
The remains of old naval engagements and lost expeditions can be found drifting through the systems that the longago admirals and explorers once in charge of these ruined flotillas had sought to claim. The remains of an invasion fleet pounded to scrap by the system’s defenders could circle the system’s rim, or a collection of scout ships might hover just beyond the orbit of a planet where they could have replenished their failing supplies. More often, determining the origin of the vessels involved is impossible, after centuries of degradation and the attention of passing scavengers have long since stripped away anything recognisable from their hulls. Still, taking time to search the wreckage of a Starship Graveyard proves profitable as often as not. Supplies such as fuel, spare plating, or conduits can be found intact with some frequency, and some hulks contain full cargo holds, or even intact Ship Components of great worth. A Starship Graveyard can consist of anywhere from three to twenty or more vessels, although most of them are far beyond any attempts at salvage. The origin of these ships is only rarely consistent with any star-faring inhabitation a System might have. A successful defence would allow them full salvage of any losses, and an intact civilisation usually means there have been no unsuccessful defences. To determine the make-up of the fleet (or fleets) involved, roll on Table 1–5: Starship Graveyard Origins. The nature of the race or races that produced the ships is left to the GM’s discretion. Game Masters can use the ships from pages 194–196 of ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook, which usually indicates a fleet of human (but not necessarily Imperial) construction, or, if they have access to volumes such as BATTLEFLEET KORONUS, they can find sundry strange and deadly xenos ships there. A Starship Graveyard contains 1d10+2 Archeotech Cache or Xenos Ruins Resources, each of which has an Abundance of 25+2d10 (see page 27). There might even be a mix of Archeotech Cache and Xenos Ruins Resources, if this stellar grave site is an ancient battlefield where multiple species met in cataclysmic conflict. Any individual vessel or conglomeration of ships can be treated as a Derelict Vessel Encounter Site (see pages 59–60), should the Explorers choose to board it.
