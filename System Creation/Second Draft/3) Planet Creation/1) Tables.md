The Body of a Planet reflects both its mass and its surface area. A more massive Planet usually has a strong gravitational field, and the more massive, solid Planets often contain particularly dense or concentrated mineral deposits. Larger Planets have the room to support more diversity in any climate or ecosystem that they develop. Where the size or mass of a Planet is unusual, its effects are noted in the description. Roll on Table 1–6: Body and consult the results for “Rocky Planets” or “Gas Giants,” depending on the particulars of the Planet being generated.

| Roll 2d6 | Rocky Body | Roll 2d6 | Gas Giant |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- | --------- |
| 11 - 16  | Low-Mass:           | 1        | Gas Dwarf:          |
| 21 - 26  | Small:|  2-5        | Gas Giant:          |
| 31 - 36  | Small and Dense:           |  6        | Massive Gas Giant:         |
| 41 - 46  |  Large:          |          |           |
| 51 - 56  | Large and Dense:|          |           |
| 61 -66         | Vast:         |          |           |

##### Rocky Body
* Low-Mass: The world is even lower in mass than its small size would suggest. It is likely comprised of light materials, or it has large pockets of trapped gas making up much of its volume. Apply –7 to the result of any roll on Table 1–7: Gravity. Generate Resources and Environments as if the world was Small. Mineral Resource deposits cannot exceed Limited in abundance.
* Small: This world lacks the mass and size to support significant gravity or resources. Apply –5 to the result of any roll on Table 1–7: Gravity.
* Small and Dense: The shrunken silhouette of this Planet belies the strength of its gravity well and the richness of its crust. Generate Resources and Environments as if the world was Small. Add +10 to the result of any on Table 1–19: Resource Abundance for any Mineral Resources. 
* Large: Worlds of this size can range across a vast spectrum of possible types. 
* Large and Dense: Though impressive in volume, the mass of this world is, in fact, compressed significantly. Add +5 to the result of any roll on Table 1–7: Gravity. Generate Resources and Environments as if the world was Large. Add +10 to the result of any roll on Table 1–19: Resource Abundance for any Mineral Resources. 
* Vast: Huge and voluminous, worlds of this type strain the upper edges of the possible size for a single world. Such Planets tend to be of middling density, as they are already more massive than is common. Add +4 to the result of any roll on Table 1–7: Gravity. 

##### Gas Giant
* Gas Dwarf: Although much smaller than the typical world of this sort, a Gas Dwarf is still considerably more massive than most rocky Planets. Apply –5 to the result of any roll on Table 1–7: Gravity.
* Gas Giant: Typical gas giants are vastly more massive than almost any other world, and tend to have correspondingly powerful gravitational effects. 
* Massive Gas Giant: The largest gas giants can rival weaker stars in size and mass, with some of them having some degree of kinship with such bodies. Add +3 to the result of any roll on Table 1–7: Gravity. In addition, any Massive Gas Giant not in the Inner Cauldron has a chance of being one of these titans. When generating a Massive Gas Giant, roll 1d10; on a result of 8 or higher, count the result of the roll made for it on Table 1–7: Gravity as a result of 10, and its moons are generated as if they were one Solar Zone closer to their star. Otherwise, treat it normally.

##### Rocky Planets
| 1d6 | Roll Gravity | Orbital Features |
| --- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 1   |  Low Gravity: Apply –10 to any roll on Table 1–8: Orbital Features. Apply –2 to any roll on Table 1–9: Atmospheric Presence. It follows all the rules for Low Gravity Worlds (see page 269 of the ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook).            |  1d5–3 (Minimum 1)                |
| 2-5 |  Normal Gravity: This Planet’s gravity is roughly Terran Standard.            |  1d5–2 (Minimum 1)                |
| 6    |  High Gravity: Add +10 to any roll on Table 1–8: Orbital Features. Add +1 to the roll on Table 1–9: Atmospheric Presence. This Planet follows all the rules for High Gravity Worlds (see page 269 of the ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook).            |   1d5–1 (Minimum 1)               |
##### Gas Giants
| Roll 1d6 | Gravity | Orbital Features |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| 1        | Weak: Though puny by the standards of gas giants, this gravity well is stronger than that of almost any solid Planet. Add +10 to any roll on Table 1–8: Orbital Features.    |  1d10–5 (Minimum 1)                |
| 2 - 3    |Strong: This gas giant has the impressive gravity well common to such worlds. Add +15 to any roll on Table 1–8: Orbital Features.         |     1d10–3 (Minimum 1)             |
| 4 - 5    | Powerful: The influence of this gravity well extends well beyond the immediate presence of its source, drawing in whatever passes by. Add +20 to any roll on Table 1–8: Orbital Features.        | 1d10+2                 |
| 6         | Titanic: The effects of such a vast gravity well on the ordering of the System are second only to its Star. Add +30 to any roll on Table 1–8: Orbital Features.        |  3d5+3                |

| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11 - 26  | No Features: No notable features are added to the Planet's orbit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 31 - 46  | Large Asteroid: An asteroid of unusual size has been captured by the Planet's gravity well, and now occupies a stable orbit around it. It is just a large enough to be noted by an orbital survey, but not enough to be seen from the Planet's surface without visual enhancement. |
| 51 - 56  | Lesser Moon: An orbital body somewhere between an extremely large asteroid and a very small moon orbits the Planet. It has its own extremely limited gravity well, allowing low-graity travel across the surface.                                                                  |
| 61 - 66  | Moon: A true moon is generated as a Planet, using the rules for Planet Creation. Under normal circumstances, a moon cannot have a higher Planetary Body than the world around which is orbits. In addition, a moon never generates its own Orbital Features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 22 - 31  | Planetary Rings (Debris): A narrow band of asteroids or chunks of ice extends out around the Gas Giant. While the limited spread means that avoiding the field requires a detour, a vessel with cause to pass directly through the ring must make a Challenging Pilot (Space Craft)+Manoeuvrability Test as if passing through an Asteroid Field. Multiple instances of this Orbital Feature increase the size of the rings.                             |
| 32 - 41  | Planetary Rings (Dust): A wide ring of fine particles encircles the gas giant. While the limited spread prevents it from becoming a naitational hazard like a trust dust cloud or nebula, and tests using the ship's auger arrays on a target wihtin, on, or directly through the ring are two steps more difficult. Multiple instances of this Orbital Feature increase the size of the existing Planetary Rings instead of adding extra sets of Rings. |
| 42 - 51  | Lesser Moon: An orbital body somewhere between an extremely large asteroid and a very small moon orbits the Planet. It hs its own extremely limited gravity well, allowing low-gravitgy travel across the surface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 1                    | None: The Planet has no atmosphere, or it has one so thin as to effectively nonexistent. Activity on the Planet is treated as being in a cavuum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 1                       | Deadly: An atmosphere of this sort is a little more than a vast acid bath. Anyone not protected by a full environmental seal suffers 1d5+1 Damage each Round that ignore the Toughness Bonus and Armor. If the atmosphere is also Heavy, it wears away at the resistance, breaking into environmental seals after 1d10+2 hours.    |
| 2 - 3                | Thin: The Planet's atmosphere is weak, but avoids the problems of an atual vacuum. Tests to avoid harm from a Toxic or Corrosive atmosphere are made at a +10 bonus. However, the lack of air makes strenuous activity difficult. Any time an Explorer relying on the Outside air gains Fatigue, he gains the normal amount plus one additional level of Fatigue instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 2 -3                    | Corrosive: THis atmosphere is both poisonous to breathe and deadly on any sort of contact. Anyone not protected by a full encironmental seal must make a Diffictult Toughness Test each Round, or suffer 1d5 Damage that ignores Armor and Toughness Bonus. Continued exposure results in Suffocation.    |
| 4 - 5                | Moderate: Atmospheres in this range produce no ill effects due to lack of overabundance of air. though they can still be toxic or corrosive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 4                    | Toxic: Poisonous gases and vapors fill the Planet's atmosphere. Simply breathing the air requires a Challenging Toughness Test each ROund to avoid suffering 1 Damage that ignores Toughness Bonus and Armor. Additionally, continued exposure results in suffocation.    |
| 6                    | Heavy: A think blanket of air presses down on the Planet, coming just short of smothering those beneath it. This oppressive weight imposes a -5 pentaly on Stranth or Toughness Tests, at the GM's discretion. Tests to avoid harm from a Toxic or Corrosive Atmophere are made at a -10 penalty. If the atmosphere is breathable, the thickness of the air makes it difficult to take in. A full hour of relying on such an atmosphere for air inflicts a single level of Fatigue. This effect is not cumulative, no mater how long a character relies on the air.
