Bountiful

=== end-column ===

A System with this System Feature has been blessed with an abundance of rare and unusual materials. The formation of the nearby stars might have bled off an unusual amount of exotic materials, or the System could have become saturated with such resources as passing meteors and comets became trapped in their gravity wells. However it came about, the area is now a veritable storehouse of mineral treasures, waiting to be tapped in the name of profit. Habitable worlds within such an area are highly prized as possible colony sites, although well-equipped Rogue Traders have been known to set up their mining operations on worlds that would not normally allow human settlement.

When generating this System, the GM should apply one or more of the following effects:
•	 Add one Asteroid Belt or Asteroid Cluster to any one Solar Zone.
•	 When the Explorers approach an Asteroid Belt or Asteroid Cluster in this System, roll 1d10. On a result of 6 or higher, roll 1d5 additional times on Table 1–20: Mineral Resources (see page 29) for that Asteroid Belt or Cluster.
•	 Roll one additional time on Table 1–20: Mineral Resources (see page 29) when generating Planets in this System, determining Abundance normally.
•	 When the Explorers approach a Planet in this System, roll 1d10. On a result of 7 or higher, that Planet has one additional “Exotic Materials” Resource.

Gravity Tides

=== end-column ===

In most systems, the pull of gravity is a constant and unchangeable fact of the universe, surer than the light of the stars in the sky. However, in some regions of space, the cataclysmic turmoil of certain fundamental forces causes gravitational fields to churn like a storm-wracked sea. Fierce gravity riptides have been known to tear apart the hulls of voidships too incautious to head the warnings of their augers, and some of the worst such anomalies become bleak legends among experienced helmsmen. Tales of the Invisible Reef and the Mouth of the Void are a staple of gossiping voidsmen in Port Wander. Some tides of gravity are gentler, and can be a boon to crews desperate for planetfall, swiftly bearing vessels along hidden currents in space. These streams are resources as treasured as the riptides are feared.

When generating this System, the GM should apply one of the following effects:
•	 Add 1d5 Gravity Riptides to the System. These additions can be placed in any Solar Zone.
•	 The gravity wells surrounding Planets in this System churn like whirlpools, battering orbiting vessels with their fluctuations. Safely entering orbit with a voidship requires a Difficult (–10) Pilot (Space Craft) Test, causing the loss of 1 point of Hull Integrity for every two Degrees of Failure. Small craft can enter and exit the gravity well only after the pilot passes a Very Hard (–30) Pilot (Flyers) Test. Every full day spent in orbit requires an additional Pilot Test.
•	 Travel between Planets within this System takes half the usual time.
