The session should begin with a bit of roleplaying. Let the players settle into their characters. To help prod them along the console should begin making noises. A DN 0 Tech test will fix the problem, but not before flashing a symbol across the screen (See handwritten notes for [[Maliax|Oriax]]). It will be mixed in with a bunch of the gibberish flashing across the screen, but ut will repeat often enough that any characterthat succeeds at a DN 3 Awareness test will realize there is a repeating symbol, but won't be able to make it out. If one of the characters is of the Inquisition, then they can make a DN 5 Scholar Test. Success means they identify it as one of the Thousand Sons legion of Traitor Astartes. Only if the get 2 exalted icons with the get the name, [[Maliax|Oriax]]. 
After about 3 days a ship enters orbit. An Inquisitoral Cruiser. It proceeds to open fire on most of the pods, sparing only a few. The characters are brought on board and are greeted by blessed and warded weapon servitors. They are taken to a quarantine cell. the cell itself is covered in runes designed to sever all link to the warp. They have access to basic sanitary facilities, and water. The water in these systems are blessed. Any character suffering corruption will take 1 ~~wound per corruption point. This damage, no matter how much taken, cannot kill the character.~~ ==Perhaps change it to shock instead of a wound, and it can't be removed without a blessing. Shock is reduced by 1 for each point of corruption.==

This will trigger several sisters of silence, accompanied by gun servitors to remove the character for testing and cleansing. This takes 2 hours per corruption point. It requires no input on the corrupted character. Once cleansed the character is returned to the part.

A few hours later the characters meet the Inquisitor's Interogator, [Algernon Blackwood] [^1]. After he introduces himself, and verifies their names , he starts asking questions about their travel, their points of origin, final destination, purpose, occupations, etc. If any of the characters identify themselves as Inquisitorial agents (Acolyte or Adept) he asks who their patron is. Since they have none he presses them into his service. Finally, he begins to ask about their experiences aboard the ship. If they encountered the Chaos Marine, they are pressed further for any identifying information. If it is [[Maliax|Oriax]] himself he ends the questioning and leaves, instructing his staff to give the characters rooms and acquaint them with the rules of the ship.

About a day later the characters are summoned to the same room they were questioned in. This time he informs them they are now all in service to the Inquisition, and presents them with data-slates and a minor symbol of office. He then proceeds to brief them on the nature of their current situation.

*Note: The Interrogator should be gruff, and straight to business.*
"Welcome to the Inquisition. LEts' get down to business." The data-slaets flicker to life, displaying the image of a [description of man]. This is [name of man]. He and Sister Reinnoris are traveling from the hospital on Ostia to their chapter house on [Planet Name]. You are going to represent the Inquisition and serve as their escorts."

Afterwards they will be given an assignment, a simple fact retrieval mission. One of the patience in St. Deploratus' Sanitarium has begun speaking in an ancient Terran dialect, talking of red mouths, and silent screams. Inquisitor Blackwood wishes to question him further, from the safety of his ship.

[[Mother Katine]]: Head of the Order
Battle Brother {Name Later}: Working with the Order temporarily. Side Missions?

The mission should be a simple pickup and drop-off. The Sanitarium should be old, but extremely well maintained. The Sisters themselves should be Troops with, (to be finished)

The Mother Superior should be played as a stereotypical mother superior from movies. Old, wise, slight aloof, perhaps a tad condescending, and a whole lot of "holier than thou." Her second should be to the point, as she has numerous issues to deal with. The other sisters, if not directly engaged, should assist as needed.

The man himself is from the agri world of Ostia. He was injured when he stumbled on a burried rock. He suffered a massive energy shock [^2]. Mild coma with strange results. Started speakng in an old Terran tounge. He was taken to the local hospital. One of the Sisters, [[Sister Reinnoris]], on temporary assignment there thought she recognized the language. After a small bit of research at the local Chapter House she requested him to be moved to their main Chapter House. Further investigation prompted the Order to contact the Inquisition.




[^1]: Algernon Blackwood is a former Imperial Commissar. While taking down andy responses from the players characters he uses his auto-quill. If questioned he explains that electronic data can be manipulated and changed, demonstrating with a nearby dataslate. Once all testimony is taken from the players, he pricks each of their fingers ad uses a blood fingerprint next to their written names on the parchment. Once each of the players are done, he does the same for himself.
