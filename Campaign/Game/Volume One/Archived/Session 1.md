The players will start aboard the '[[Valiant Explorer]]'. {Details of daytime activity will go here.} The Valiant Explorer uses communal sleeping areas. Passengers have either a foot locker, or a wall locker to store their things. Beds are bulk, military surplus. During the night one of their fellow passengers, an unsanctioned psyker, begins to become a portal for the Warp.

You are awoken to the unnatrual undulations of your bunk. In the back of the room a hideous light can be seen pulsing and spilling into the room. At its source is a man, convulsing, screaming. Amid his wretched screaming you can barely discern four words. "ROTTEN WORLD! DEAD WAR! RED MOUTH! EMPTY SCREAM!" With a final rending scream his mouth begins to open as if being pulled apart. The sinew and bone cracking, snapping, and oozing to accommodate. His teeth falling to the deck, melting, bubbling into impossible squriming things that pulsed vile sounds and smells, warping all it touched into impossible geometries. With a final gruesome crack, the top of his head falls to the deck, scuttling into the vents. His body bulges and writhes as [[Chaos Spawn]] crawl into reality from the shredded meat of his body, and flayed remains of his soul.

#### [Combat]
[[Chaos Spawn]] x 1 (Core P.421-422)

At the conclusion of the encounter, and due to the catastrophic effects, the unleashed creatures were having on the ship and passengers the players should be motivated to leave the birthing quarters. As they make their way to the savior pods of the ship, they should encounter a number of obstacles whose purpose is to let the players get used to skill tests.

[[Custom Tables#^440a52|Random Complication and Encounter Tables]]
Note: Finding resources, such as ammo, and medical supplies shouldn't be hard. A DN 2 Investigation for ammo, and a DN 3 for Medical Supplies.

The first session should conclude with them getting into a savior pod. There is no nearby system for the pod to travel to. A simple tech, or pilot skill test (DN 2. The pod is badly maintained) will activate the distress beacon.

**Reward: 5 Build Points (Total 5)**
