Durring a routine expedition the [Noctis Aeterna opens](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Noctis_Aeterna) causing a massive surge in the Warp, briefly overwhelming the Gellar fields. The outpost is lost. What emerges from the warp no long resembles the outpost it once was. The Mechanicum agents aboard become Flesh Priests, utilizing the organic crew as parts for the corrupted mass the outpost has become. Eyes and nervous systems replace the mechanical circuitry. Muscles and organs have become the vital systems. Brains, the computers. Bones the structure. Their souls and screams the fuel.
