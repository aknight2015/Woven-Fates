The surface of Daedalon, the Gilead System’s cemetery, is almost entirely covered in graves, tombs, and skyscraper-tall mausoleums. The revered bones of the System’s most celebrated heroes and saints are interred on holy Enoch, while the remaining trillions are sent to Daedalon to be processed. Daedalon’s skylines are a constant reminder of the moon’s designated purpose. Noble families build ever taller and more complex burial housings in competition for status and real estate. Acres of barely marked headstones are set aside for ranking labourers and the many soldiers that have fallen since the emergence of the Great Rift, punctuated by modest crypts for the corpses of adepts. Between these Boneyards are Daedalon’s Ecclesiarchy-regulated settlements. While the Imperial Creed is far from a religion that celebrates the joys of life, the culture of the cemetery moon is particularly morbid. Citizens make their homes and businesses between the numerous crypts, mausoleums, and graveyards. As on any Imperial world, the Imperial Creed’s cathedrals are ubiquitous; broadcasting traditional hymns akin to funeral dirges from vox-hailers. Daedalon’s industry largely focuses on the construction and maintenance of graves, but many are also employed in the crucial refining of corpse starch to supplement the Gilead System’s dwindling food supplies. Servo-Skulls are in unsurprising abundance, and some are used in inventive ways, including being lashed together to pull and transport large objects with their anti-grav motors. The underclasses and scum of the cities once made a living guiding pilgrims and mourners to specific grave sites, but reprehensible blasphemers have profited from graverobbing for decades, creating a market for automated tomb defenses.
