Charybdion is an Imperial Ocean World that lies within the Gilead System.
Classification: Hive World (Sub-category: Ocean World)
Population: Approximately four billion
Geography: Rocky islands, long, jagged cliffs, massive reef structures
Planetary Governance: Governor Ganthet Veneratio — Deceased
Governor-Militant Lord Inquisitor-General Victor deBourgogne Ray XVI

Tithe Grade: Aptus Nihil (no longer capable of paying Terra’s Due)

The “black pearl” of the Gilead System, Charybdion is a world mostly composed of dark, roiling oceans seething with pollution and rich with chemical waste. A handful of rocky continental plates rise above sea level, and the planet’s hives cling to these islands like drowning men.

The planet possesses numerous promethium refineries that support military and industrial efforts across the system. Established by the original Adeptus Mechanicus Explorator fleet that discovered the system thousands of years ago, the refineries are confined within sealed machine-temples on the ocean’s floor. Some of these machine-temples have fallen silent and lie dormant, whilst others have been torn apart by ravening riptides and geological events. Tech-Priests organise small teams and dispatch them to the depths to salvage some of these ancient technologies.

The planetary governor’s enforcers maintain a sizable prison facility named Ironwatch. The governor has been forced to confine psykers gathered for the tithe to the Black Ships in this forbidding tower. The prison is connected to the capital hive, Aidon, and has numerous failsafes intended to cast the tower down into the sea should it become necessary. In recent years, the buildup of psykers has caused Ironwatch to become a haunted, horrific place, filled with misery, terror and the collected psychic nightmares of its growing population of prisoners. Rising sea levels have swallowed many of the smaller islands, and the lowest levels of many hives now lie beneath the waves.

In the underhive regions on Charybdion, the inhabitants ==struggle to seal leaks and deal with corrosion==, lest they drown in the foul seawater kept outside the hive’s hull-like outer walls. Some regions have been abandoned wholesale to the ocean depths. Much of the industry of the underhives on this world revolves around the hunting of ==worldfish, huge, bloated sea creatures heavily mutated by the ever-present pollution.== Worldfish produce flesh, bone, oil and many other by-products that are prized amongst the populations of the lower hives across the planet.

It has begun to seethe with discontent and danger. Worse still, its Planetary Governor has disappeared without a trace and his councilors are now struggling to select a suitable heir to replace him. All while mysterious murders, nightmares, and other dangers threaten to cast Charybdion into anarchy and despair.

With the death of the Planetary Governor and his successors, the world fell into anarchy and is currently being invading by the Children of Torment Black Legion warband.
