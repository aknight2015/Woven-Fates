# The Voidmire

The Voidmire is a treacherous region of real space that runs up against the roiling Warp storms of Cicatrix Maledictum. Here the tides of the Empyrean flow back and forth in a chaotic display of cackling insanity, breaking against the rock of the ‘real’ before receding again into the rift.

Dead ships litter the space of the Voidmire, along with fragments of broken worlds, shards of asteroid collisions, and alien cityscapes drifting silently in this coreward shoal. The shifting nature of the Warp crossing into reality makes navigation in this region hazardous for all but the most skilled crews and talented navigators, as translation between the Empyrean and realspace may happen without warning.

Heretics in service to the Traitor Legions and Ruinous Powers haunt the flickering edge of the Warp and lurk among the derelict ships, ready to ambush vessels foolish enough to draw close. Raids launch from rips in realspace targeting conveys on the fringes of Imperial space, or even between the Heartworlds if a Warp flare tears open close enough.

However, the true dominion of the Voidmire lies not in the hands of Chaos but those of the xenos. The Emerald Princess Ferianwyr, the swaggering corsair queen, lays claim to the entire Voidmire, supported by her Greensteel Warriors Corsair coterie. Though a fragile agreement holds between Ferianwyr and the Varonius Flotilla, the sleek and fickle corsair vessels may choose to raid anything not flying the flag of House Varonius.
