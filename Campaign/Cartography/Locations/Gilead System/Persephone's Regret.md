# Persephone’s Regret

Persephone’s Regret tumbles through the outer void of the Reach, a space hulk of immense proportions drifting inexorably towards the Heartworlds. The labyrinthine mass of the hulk is a war zone — Genestealers and Orks infest Persephone’s Regret in vast numbers, ceaselessly slaughtering each other for centuries. The population of either xenos could spell the doom of a world, should the hulk pass close enough. Together the hostile aliens could be the end of the Gilead System, should they ever spread beyond the hull of the Persephone’s Regret. Recent, scattered reports suggest that somehow this may have already happened. Cults of personality have shown up in communities on several worlds, entire ships have fallen silent with their final broadcasts being desperate screams for help, and a few horrifying accounts report Orks falling from the sky.
