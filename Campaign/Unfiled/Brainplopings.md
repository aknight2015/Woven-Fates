Orias, Oriax/Malal -> Maliax

A second [[Antithesis Stone]] exists on the world of [[Geotrope XII]]. Able to bring in one of the NPCs from the [[shattered-hope-lo 1.pdf|Shattered Hope]] adventure.

Antithesis Stone used to weaken forces of Vigilus in order to collapse the Nachmund Guantlet and isolate Imperum Nihilus from the Imperium at large and leave it vulnerable to the predations of Chaos.

Also desires Blackstone for himself.

Shattered Hope takes place durring Hive Fleet Behemoth.

Geotrope XII, blackstone, Antithesis Stone. 
Maliax needs raw blackstone. Geotrope XII is a mining world. Also massive conflict zone.
DId the events of Shattered Hope conceal another plot? Goremaw? Dimensional Key? 


One of the products of Geotrope XII is raw blackstone.

Geotrope XII is the world that circles closest to the Astravigilia star and serves as a Mining World for the system. Penal laborers -> Blood Games -> Goremaw. Deaths are attributed to mining accidents. An abnormal amount of accidents raise suspicions. 

A corrupt Arbite helps cover up the blood games. (Should I tie that in to Tzeentch?)

"From the plough-blade prow, for massive torpedoes slid free. They were immense, as large as some of the smaller ships in the fleet. Void drives made up the back third. Servitors hardwired into their missle's extensive gotitation suites guided them. THey had their own batteries of point defence weapons, jamming suites and decoy launchers, for the warheads they carried were precious indeed.
Carried by each was a cluster of caskets, arranged like the slugs in a stub-revolver's chamber deep inside the missile's layered armour. There were eighteen, in three rows of six capsules, a small payload for such a might delivery system, but devastating to the right target.
Within the capsules were the refined remains of pariahs, individuals who, like the Sister of Silence, had a minimal presence in the warp and whose very existence was anathema to the creatures and energies of that realm. It was heretical weaponry according to some, and vanishingly rare."

-Corruption and infection of organic parts of servitor. 

"At the point where the walls retained their original rockcrete and plasteel structure, the torpedoes juddered slightly, the melta arrays burned more loudly, and needles dropped a little quicker on the dials displaying the limited power source of the vessels. No more notice was given than that. The jump and skip of internal voice encountered in a layered metal structure were not there. Vile growth filled them all, imprisoning mechanisms and men alike in a fleshy hell."
-Page 127

-Organics used as filters and growth environments. They filter out the healthy, and put out the corrupted. The bodies used to cultivate new mutations and viruses.
-Souls are used the same way, but for the immaterial instead of the material.

Take the pariah missiles and twist them around. Make it so that it opens a stable warp rift.
