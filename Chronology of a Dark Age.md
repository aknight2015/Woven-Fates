title: CHRONOLGOY OF A DARK AGE

The chronology of Vigilus, as denoted in records of the War of Beasts, uses as its anchor point the opening of the Great Rift above the planet. This was an event of such incredible magnitude it rewired the planet’s temporal logic altogether, much as it did a thousand other war zones across the Imperium. 

The first element of Vigilus’ timestamp is the annual designator. It starts with the number of years either before or after the rift opened, and then a number of chronosegments within that year as the second element. Imperial days are broken down into chronosegments of eight hours. After this is a third element – either ‘previo’ if the events occurred before the opening of the Great Rift, or ‘post’ if after it. This third element is sometimes denoted as a minus sign or a plus sign. 

The fourth element of the Vigilus timestamp is the system’s designator initials; in essence, the initials of the system to which it refers. For Vigilus, this is VCM which stands for ‘Vigilus Cicatrix Maledictum’. For its neighbouring planet, Omis-Prion, the designator initials would be OPCM. 

By way of a full example, if the time of an event in the Vigilus System was three days (nine chronosegments) before the opening of the Great Rift, the timestamp would be ‘0.9 previo VCM.M41’, also expressed as ‘0.9 previo’ or ‘0.9–’. 
This translates as ‘0 years and 9 chronosegments (three days) previous to the Vigilus System’s first instance of the Cicatrix Maledictum in the 41st Millennium.’ 

If it was one year and eight hours after, the timestamp would be ‘1.1 post VCM.M41’, also expressed as ‘1.1 post’ or ‘1.1+
