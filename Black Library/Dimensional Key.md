title: Dimensional Key
collapse: none
```
Dimensional Keys are artefacts of Chaos that are ancient relics carved from the thighbones of Daemon Princes. Should these Keys be thrust into the body of a dying warrior then the veil between the Warp and realspace is pierced. This creates a gale of Chaotic energy that disorientes mortals that are not in service to the Chaos Gods. A more dangerous ability of these Keys is their capacity to guide those nearby through the Warp.
