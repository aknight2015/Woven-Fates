The Altymhor Dynasty is a Necron Dynasty in Segmentum Obscurus ruled over by the Overlord Vitokh. The Dynasty has demonstrated a desire for non-Necron slaves, as demonstrated when they overran and enslaved the Imperial world of Aryand.

The Altymhor desecrated the sacred artifacts of Aryand, which originally belonged to the Nephrekh Dynasty. Upon awakening the Dynasty's mad Phaeron Sylphek became incensed and drove the Altymhor off the world.
